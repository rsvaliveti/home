# rsvaliveti.github.io

This repository contains the jekyll sources required to generate my website. Note the following:
* This site uses: a) Jekyll minima theme b) Jekyll scholar plugin to process BibTeX files. 
* Since jekyll-scholar is not an approved plug-in, the build must be handled in a "GitHub Actions" script. 
* This repo has two branches: master, gh-pages.
* The jekyll sources are maintained in the 'master' branch. 
* The contents of the _site directory generated by jekyll are pushed to the branch called "gh-pages". The website (rsvaliveti.github.io) serves this content.
